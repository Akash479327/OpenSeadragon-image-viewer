# OpenSeadragon-image-viewer


HI, 
I have tried my Best But still not succeed as the time is up.
When I tried to run the image it shows no image found.
As i had hard time understanding the VMIC file donot know is the as there is no error in the code, and also internet was not so helpful also as i have worked with OpenSeadragon for the first time.

Here i have tried to run the OpenSea dragon image inside a image as u can see i have committed.
